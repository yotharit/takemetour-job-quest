### TakeMeTour Internship Program 2018

Hi all applicants! Welcome to TakeMeTour Internship Program 2018. Being and intern at TakeMeTour is challenging so we have challenges for you! These challenges are designed to assess your learning skill, which is the fundamental and most important skill of great software developer. So I do not expect you to have full or any knowledge about the topic beforehand but it's your job to try to learn and answer those challenges.

## Algorithm in Javascript
Code must be writted in Javascript language. The code will be tested with Node8, so you can use all Javascript features that equivalent to Node8.

1. Write a function that shift the elements of array to left or right by n elements in infinity loop. the function recevice 3 parameters, 1st is an array, 2nd the is direction ('left' or 'right'), 3rd is the number of elements will be shifted. For example,
```
> shift(['john', 'jane', 'sarah', 'alex'], 'left', 2)
['sarah', 'alex', 'john', 'jane']

> shift([1, 2, 3, 4 ,5], 'right', 3)
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

Answer:

```
function shift(array, direction, number){
  for(i = 0; i < number; i++){
      if(direction == 'right') array.unshift(array.pop());
      if(direction == 'left') array.push(array.shift());
  }
  return array;
}

```
